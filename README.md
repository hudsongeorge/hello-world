I am Hudson George. I've been in management for the most part of my career, about 20 years.
I started as a programmer/analyst using VBA but after 6 months because a Sales Supervisor.
7 months later I was heading a team of Sales support and web developers. From there on, for the past 17 years, I've been managing technical people from Network Administrators, Technical Support, Solution Architects, Integration Engineers, Web Developers. I also managed Project Managers.
Now I'm into home automation and security and had been dabbling with web development, PHP, Arduino, Raspberry Pi, Data Science.
